// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to printout the name of each animal.
// • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet.
// • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. 
// You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!

let petAnimals = ["cat","duck", "Dog"]

//using for-loop
for(let onePet of petAnimals){

    //print a statement about each animal,
    console.log(`A ${onePet} would make a great pet.`)

}

//print out side

console.log("Any of these animals would make a great pet!")
